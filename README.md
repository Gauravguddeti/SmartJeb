```

### Mobile App Builds

SmartJeb is available as a mobile app for both Android and iOS platforms using Capacitor, which wraps our existing web app into native mobile applications. When you make changes to the GitHub repository, they will automatically be reflected in both the web version and mobile applications after rebuilding.

#### Building and Updating the Mobile Apps

The mobile apps are built from the same codebase as the web application, ensuring consistent behavior across all platforms. Here's the workflow to update both web and mobile versions:

1. Make changes to the codebase
2. Push changes to GitHub (web version will update automatically via CI/CD)
3. Follow these steps to update mobile apps with your changes:

#### Building for Android

1. Build the web app:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Sync web code to Android:
```bash
npx cap sync android
```

3. Open in Android Studio:
```bash
npx cap open android
```

4. Build the APK in Android Studio:
   - Go to Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
   - Find the APK in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`
   - (Optional) Sign the APK for distribution

#### Building for iOS

1. Build the web app (if not already done):
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Sync web code to iOS:
```bash
npx cap sync ios
```

3. Open in Xcode:
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

4. Build the app in Xcode:
   - Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities tab
   - Build the project using Product > Build
   - Archive for distribution using Product > Archive

#### Automated Build Script

You can run the following script to build both web and mobile versions in one go:

```bash
# Add this to your package.json scripts
# "build-mobile": "npm run build && npx cap sync"

# Then run:
npm run build-mobile
```
